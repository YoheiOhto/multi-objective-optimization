# data preparation
If you want to use data other than ToxCast and ICE, please create a CSV file with two columns: one for CASRN and the other for toxicity intensity/presence. Then, run the "For your own data" section in the 3_preprocess_for_lookup.ipynb notebook.  
  
Also, if you plan to run a genetic algorithm, please configure the values in the experiment/notebook appropriately.
